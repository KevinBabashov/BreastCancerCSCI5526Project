# BreastCancerCSCI5526Project
This Repository is a culmination of the work of Andrea Arifin (Who created the base model), Kevin Babashov, Krista Goergen, and Yousef Saad within CSCI 5526 Machine Learning for Healthcare, Fall 2025 at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.

The work is roughly separated into the following categories: 

Data Preprocessing: Krista Goergen & Andrea Arifin

Model Architecture: Yousef Saad 

Model Training: Kevin Babashov & Andrea Arifin 

**Special thanks to Andrea Arifin, who developed the backbone EfficientNetV2S that we used as our base model in her directed research course, previous to this class project.**

The GitHub repository will roughly be divided into the branches with each of the following Python notebooks:

Kevin_Babashov Branch: 
Ensemble Learning Methods + Base Model 
Positive Weighting + Base Model
Tensorflow + Kera to Pytorch switch (Failed, but included for transparency and completeness)

Andrea Arifin: 
Base Model
Focal Loss + Base Model 
Positive Weighting + Base Model
Feature Fusion + Base Model
Decision Threshold Adjustments + Base Model 

Yousef Saad: 
Feature Fusion
U-Net

Krista Goergen:
Color Normalization 
Data Augmentation 
Oversampling
